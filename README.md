## üß¨ Scientific Foundation

Based on current research and NSCA guidelines:
- **Volume**: 16-20 sets per muscle group per week (optimal hypertrophy range: 12-20)
- **Frequency**: Each muscle group trained twice per week (every 72-96 hours)
- **Rep Ranges**: 5-20 reps across different exercises for comprehensive stimulus
- **Progressive Overload**: Percentage-based increases (2.5-5% compounds, 5-10% isolation)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Initial Setup**: Complete the onboarding screen to set conservative starting weights
2. **Follow the Program**: Train 4 days per week (e.g., Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri)
3. **Trust the Process**: The app automatically calculates progressive overload
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor your weekly and daily workout statistics

## üîß Technical Stack

- **React 19** with Vite build system
- **Progressive Web App** (PWA) with offline capabilities
- **Local Storage** for workout history and progression data
- **Responsive Design** optimized for mobile devices
- **Screen Wake Lock API** to prevent screen timeout during workouts

## üåê Deployment

Deployed on Netlify with automatic builds from the master branch.
