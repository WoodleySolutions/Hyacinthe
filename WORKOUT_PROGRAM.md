## Initial Weight Assessment

### **NSCA-Based Starting Weight Guidelines**

**⚠️ Important**: The NSCA strongly recommends **AGAINST** 1RM testing for beginners due to injury risk and excessive muscle soreness.

### **Safe Assessment Methods**

**Recommended Approach**: Start with conservative weights that allow 8-12 clean reps with 2-3 reps in reserve.

### **Bodyweight-Based Starting Points** (for reference only):
- **Bench Press**: 0.5-0.75x bodyweight
- **Squat**: 0.75-1.0x bodyweight  
- **Deadlift**: 1.0-1.25x bodyweight
- **Overhead Press**: 0.4-0.6x bodyweight

### **Exercise-Specific Starting Recommendations**:
- **Compound movements**: Start 20-30% lighter than you think you can handle
- **Isolation movements**: Begin with 15-25 lbs and adjust based on feel
- **Bodyweight exercises**: Start unassisted; add weight only after mastering form

### **Hyacinthe App Onboarding**
The app includes an initial weight setup screen where you can:
- Input your comfortable starting weights for each exercise
- View suggested ranges based on exercise type
- Get NSCA-based recommendations for conservative starting points
- Reset and restart if needed

**Key Principle**: Better to start too light and progress quickly than start too heavy and compromise form or risk injury.

## Progressive Overload Guidelines

### **NSCA "2 for 2 Rule"** (Primary Method)
If you can perform 2 or more reps **at or above** the target range for 2 consecutive workouts, increase the weight.

### **Percentage-Based Weight Increases**:
- **Compound movements**: 2.5-5% increase (typically 2.5-10 lbs)
- **Isolation movements**: 5-10% increase (typically 2.5-5 lbs)
- **Minimum increment**: 2.5 lbs (rounded to nearest 2.5 lb increment)

### **Rep Range Progression**
- **6-8 reps**: Focus on strength - increase weight when hitting 8+ reps consistently
- **8-12 reps**: Hypertrophy sweet spot - increase weight when hitting 12+ reps consistently  
- **12-20 reps**: Metabolic stress - increase weight when hitting 20+ reps consistently

### **Automatic Progressive Overload**
The Hyacinthe app automatically:
- Calculates new weights based on your previous performance
- Uses NSCA percentage-based increases instead of fixed increments
- Adjusts within-workout if you exceed target reps
- Tracks progression over time for optimal results

## Rest Periods
- **Compound exercises**: 2-2.5 minutes (strength and recovery focus)
- **Isolation exercises**: 90 seconds (hypertrophy and time efficiency)

## Weekly Volume Distribution
Each muscle group receives **15 sets per week**:
- **Chest**: 9 direct + 6 indirect (from shoulders/triceps) = 15 total
- **Back**: 9 direct + 6 indirect (from deadlifts/biceps) = 15 total  
- **Shoulders**: 6 direct + 9 indirect (from pressing) = 15 total
- **Legs**: 15 direct sets covering all major muscle groups

## Program Progression

### **Weeks 1-4: Foundation Phase**
- Focus on form mastery
- Start with conservative weights
- Build conditioning for the volume

### **Weeks 5-8: Hypertrophy Phase**
- Push intensity within rep ranges
- Focus on progressive overload
- Mind-muscle connection emphasis

### **Weeks 9-12: Intensification Phase**
- Peak weights within rep ranges
- Consider deload week 12 or program change

## Scientific Rationale

This program is designed based on:
- **NSCA hypertrophy guidelines**: 6-12 rep range at 67-85% 1RM
- **2024 volume research**: 12-20 sets per muscle group per week for optimal growth
- **Frequency optimization**: Each muscle group trained every 72 hours for protein synthesis
- **Time efficiency**: Maximum results within 45-minute constraint

*"Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during exercise training. It is a key principle in strength training and hypertrophy."* - NSCA Guidelines
