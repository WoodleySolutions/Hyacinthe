## Progressive Overload Guidelines

### **Rep Range Progression**
- **6-8 reps**: Focus on strength - increase weight when you can complete all sets at top of range
- **8-12 reps**: Hypertrophy sweet spot - increase weight when completing 12 reps on all sets
- **12-20 reps**: Metabolic stress and endurance - focus on muscle fatigue and mind-muscle connection

### **Weight Progression**
- **Compound movements** (Bench, Squat, Deadlift, OHP, Rows): +5-10 lbs when target reps achieved
- **Isolation movements** (Laterals, Curls, Calf Raises): +2.5-5 lbs when target reps achieved
- **Bodyweight movements** (Dips, Pull-ups): Add weight or increase reps

### **"2 for 2 Rule"**
If you can perform 2 or more additional reps beyond the target range for 2 consecutive workouts, increase the weight by the smallest increment available.

## Rest Periods
- **Compound exercises**: 2-2.5 minutes (strength and recovery focus)
- **Isolation exercises**: 90 seconds (hypertrophy and time efficiency)

## Weekly Volume Distribution
Each muscle group receives **15 sets per week**:
- **Chest**: 9 direct + 6 indirect (from shoulders/triceps) = 15 total
- **Back**: 9 direct + 6 indirect (from deadlifts/biceps) = 15 total  
- **Shoulders**: 6 direct + 9 indirect (from pressing) = 15 total
- **Legs**: 15 direct sets covering all major muscle groups

## Program Progression

### **Weeks 1-4: Foundation Phase**
- Focus on form mastery
- Start with conservative weights
- Build conditioning for the volume

### **Weeks 5-8: Hypertrophy Phase**
- Push intensity within rep ranges
- Focus on progressive overload
- Mind-muscle connection emphasis

### **Weeks 9-12: Intensification Phase**
- Peak weights within rep ranges
- Consider deload week 12 or program change

## Scientific Rationale

This program is designed based on:
- **NSCA hypertrophy guidelines**: 6-12 rep range at 67-85% 1RM
- **2024 volume research**: 12-20 sets per muscle group per week for optimal growth
- **Frequency optimization**: Each muscle group trained every 72 hours for protein synthesis
- **Time efficiency**: Maximum results within 45-minute constraint

*"Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during exercise training. It is a key principle in strength training and hypertrophy."* - NSCA Guidelines
